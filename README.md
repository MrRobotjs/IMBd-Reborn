# IMBd-Reborn

A dark and modern theme for the IMDb website. Google's Material Design was kept in mind for most of the project. The current style looks old and outdated and I felt that a movie site should look and feel more modern. Keep in mind this is a <b>WIP</b> theme.

# Installation

You can go to the theme's page one <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/163692/imdb-reborn">userstyles</a> and install it directly there or use a 3rd party extension for your browser that will let you customize websites with css and then just paste the theme's css in there.
